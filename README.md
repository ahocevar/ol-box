Micro apps for building a rich mapping UI with just IFrames

## About

This repository is a proof-of-concept for a set of micro apps that can be embedded as IFrames into a web page, and communicate with each other. The result is a rich user interface, made from self-contained micro apps.

## Getting started

    git clone git@github.com:ahocevar/ol-box.git
    cd ol-box
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Finding your way around

The micro apps are in the `micro-apps/` folder. An example page that uses all of them is in `index.html`.
